# AI Workflow Infrastructure for IntelÂ® architecture

## Description
On this page you will find details and instructions on how to set up an environment that supports Intel's AI Pipelines container build and test infrastructure.

## Dependency Requirements
Only Linux systems are currently supported. Please make sure the following are installed in your package manager of choice:
- `make`
- `docker.io`

A full installation of [docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) with docker CLI is required. The recommended docker engine version is `19.03.0+`.

- `docker-compose`

The Docker Compose CLI can be [installed](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/compose-plugin/#installing-compose-on-linux-systems) both manually and via package manager.

```
$ DOCKER_CONFIG=${DOCKER_CONFIG:-$HOME/.docker}
$ mkdir -p $DOCKER_CONFIG/cli-plugins
$ curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.7.0/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o $DOCKER_CONFIG/cli-plugins/docker-compose
$ chmod +x $DOCKER_CONFIG/cli-plugins/docker-compose

$ docker compose version
Docker Compose version v2.7.0
```

## Development Container
Rather than installing the dependencies above on a bare-metal system, a base development container with the relevant dependencies for execution of MLOps validation can be built:

```docker build -f ./.github/utils/Dockerfile.compose .```

## Build and Run Workflows
Each pipeline will contain specific requirements and instructions for how to provide its specific dependencies and what customization options are possible. Generally, pipelines are run with the following format:

```git submodule update --init --recursive```

This will pull the dependent repo containing the scripts to run the end2end pipeline's inference and/or training.

```<KEY>=<VALUE> ... <KEY>=<VALUE> make <PIPELINE_NAME>```

Where `KEY` and `VALUE` pairs are environment variables that can be used to customize both the pipeline's script options and the resulting container. For more information about the valid `KEY` and `VALUE` pairs, see the README.md file in the folder for each workflow container:

|AI Workflow|Framework/Tool|Mode|
|-|-|-|
|Language Modeling|PyTorch*|[Training](./language_modeling/pytorch/bert_large/training/)|
|Vision Based Transfer Learning|TensorFlow|[Training](./transfer_learning/tensorflow/resnet50/training/) \| [Inference](./transfer_learning/tensorflow/resnet50/inference/)|

### Cleanup
Each pipeline can remove all resources allocated by executing `make clean`.
