      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Our Copyright Policy
--------------------
Nucleic uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
over their contributions to Nucleic. But, it is important to note that these
contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Nucleic
source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or
institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Nucleic
Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what
changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate
their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the
change to one of the Nucleic repositories.

With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file
to indicate the copyright and license terms:

If You have not entered into an NDA with Intel, You must not disclose, distribute or make use of any information marked as confidential, except as expressly authorized in writing by Intel. Intel retains all rights in and to its confidential information specifications, designs, engineering details, discoveries, inventions, patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other proprietary rights relating to the Materials.  Any breach by You of the confidentiality obligations provided for in this Section 9 will cause irreparable injury to Intel for which money damages may be inadequate to compensate Intel for losses arising from such a breach. Intel may obtain equitable relief, including injunctive relief, if You breach or threaten to breach Your confidentiality obligations.
 
TERM AND TERMINATION. This Agreement becomes effective on the date You accept this Agreement and will continue until terminated as provided for in this Agreement. The term for any Pre-Release Materials terminates upon release of a commercial version. This Agreement will terminate if You are in breach of any of its terms and conditions. Upon termination, You will promptly destroy the Materials and all copies. In the event of termination of this Agreement, Your license to any Redistributables distributed by You in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, prior to the effective date of such termination, will survive any such termination of this Agreement. Sections 1, 2.1.D(4)(v), 2.2, 2.3.A(iii), 2.3.B(iii), 3.3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (with respect to these survival provisions in the last sentence), and 12 will survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.
 
U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS. The technical data and computer software covered by this license is a “Commercial Item,” as such term is defined by the FAR 2.101 (48 C.F.R. 2.101) and is “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation” as specified under FAR 12.212 (48 C.F.R. 12.212) or DFARS 227.7202 (48 C.F.R. 227.7202), as applicable. This commercial computer software and related documentation is provided to end users for use by and on behalf of the U.S. Government with only those rights as are granted to all other end users pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
 
GENERAL PROVISIONS.

12.1  ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement contains the complete and exclusive agreement and understanding between the parties concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous proposals, agreements, understanding, negotiations, representations, warranties, conditions, and communications, oral or written, between the parties relating to the same subject matter. Each party acknowledges and agrees that in entering into this Agreement it has not relied on, and will not be entitled to rely on, any oral or written representations, warranties, conditions, understanding, or communications between the parties that are not expressly set forth in this Agreement. The express provisions of this Agreement control over any course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of the trade inconsistent with any of the provisions of this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement will prevail notwithstanding any different, conflicting, or additional provisions that may appear on any purchase order, acknowledgement, invoice, or other writing issued by either party in connection with this Agreement. No modification or amendment to this Agreement will be effective unless in writing and signed by authorized representatives of each party, and must specifically identify this Agreement by its title and version (e.g., “Intel End User License Agreement for Developer Tools (Version October 2021)”); except that Intel may make changes to this Agreement as it distributes new versions of the Materials. When changes are made, Intel will make a new version of the Agreement available on its website. If You received a copy of this Agreement translated into another language, the English language version of this Agreement will prevail in the event of any conflict between versions.  

12.2  EXPORT. You acknowledge that the Materials and all related technical information are subject to export controls and you agree to comply with all laws and regulations of the United States and other applicable governments governing export, re-export, import, transfer, distribution, and use of the Materials. In particular, but without limitation, the Materials may not be exported or re-exported (i) into any U.S. embargoed countries or (ii) to any person or entity listed on a denial order published by the U.S. government or any other applicable governments. By using the Materials, You represent and warrant that You are not located in any such country or on any such list. You also agree that You will not use the Materials for, or sell or transfer them to a third party who is known or suspected to be involved in, any purposes prohibited by the U.S. government or other applicable governments, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture, or production of nuclear, missile, chemical or biological weapons.

12.3  GOVERNING LAW, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE. All disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement, whether based on contract, tort, or any other legal or equitable theory, will in all respects be governed by, and construed and interpreted under, the laws of the United States of America and the State of Delaware, without reference to conflict of laws principles. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (1980) is specifically excluded from and will not apply to this Agreement. All disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement, whether based on contract, tort, or any other legal or equitable theory, will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware or of the Federal courts sitting in that State. Each party submits to the personal jurisdiction of those courts and waives all objections to that jurisdiction and venue for those disputes.

12.4  SEVERABILITY. The parties intend that if a court holds that any provision or part of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the court will modify the provision to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable, or if it cannot be made valid and enforceable, the parties intend that the court will sever and delete the provision or part from this Agreement. Any change to or deletion of a provision or part of this Agreement under this Section will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement, which will continue in full force and effect.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

ABOUT PERL
==========

Perl is a general-purpose programming language originally developed for
text manipulation and now used for a wide range of tasks including
system administration, web development, network programming, GUI
development, and more.

The language is intended to be practical (easy to use, efficient,
complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal).  Its major
features are that it's easy to use, supports both procedural and
object-oriented (OO) programming, has powerful built-in support for text
processing, and has one of the world's most impressive collections of
third-party modules.

For an introduction to the language's features, see pod/perlintro.pod.

For a discussion of the important changes in this release, see
pod/perldelta.pod.

There are also many Perl books available, covering a wide variety of topics,
from various publishers.  See pod/perlbook.pod for more information.


INSTALLATION
============

If you're using a relatively modern operating system and want to
install this version of Perl locally, run the following commands:

  ./Configure -des -Dprefix=$HOME/localperl
  make test
  make install

This will configure and compile perl for your platform, run the regression
tests, and install perl in a subdirectory "localperl" of your home directory.

If you run into any trouble whatsoever or you need to install a customized
version of Perl, you should read the detailed instructions in the "INSTALL"
file that came with this distribution.  Additionally, there are a number of
"README" files with hints and tips about building and using Perl on a wide
variety of platforms, some more common than others.

Once you have Perl installed, a wealth of documentation is available to you
through the 'perldoc' tool.  To get started, run this command:

  perldoc perl


IF YOU RUN INTO TROUBLE
=======================

Perl is a large and complex system that's used for everything from
knitting to rocket science.  If you run into trouble, it's quite
likely that someone else has already solved the problem you're
facing. Once you've exhausted the documentation, please report bugs to us
at the GitHub issue tracker at https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues

While it was current when we made it available, Perl is constantly evolving
and there may be a more recent version that fixes bugs you've run into or
adds new features that you might find useful.

You can always find the latest version of perl on a CPAN (Comprehensive Perl
Archive Network) site near you at https://www.cpan.org/src/

If you want to submit a simple patch to the perl source, see the "SUPER
QUICK PATCH GUIDE" in pod/perlhack.pod.

Just a personal note:  I want you to know that I create nice things like this
because it pleases the Author of my story.  If this bothers you, then your
notion of Authorship needs some revision.  But you can use perl anyway. :-)

LICENSING
=========

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of either:

	a) the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
	Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any
	later version, or

	b) the "Artistic License" which comes with this Kit.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See either
the GNU General Public License or the Artistic License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the Artistic License with this
Kit, in the file named "Artistic".  If not, I'll be glad to provide one.

You should also have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program in the file named "Copying". If not, write to the

For those of you that choose to use the GNU General Public License,
my interpretation of the GNU General Public License is that no Perl
script falls under the terms of the GPL unless you explicitly put
said script under the terms of the GPL yourself.  Furthermore, any
object code linked with perl does not automatically fall under the
terms of the GPL, provided such object code only adds definitions
of subroutines and variables, and does not otherwise impair the
resulting interpreter from executing any standard Perl script.  I
consider linking in C subroutines in this manner to be the moral
equivalent of defining subroutines in the Perl language itself.  You
may sell such an object file as proprietary provided that you provide
or offer to provide the Perl source, as specified by the GNU General
Public License.  (This is merely an alternate way of specifying input
to the program.)  You may also sell a binary produced by the dumping of
a running Perl script that belongs to you, provided that you provide or
offer to provide the Perl source as specified by the GPL.  (The
fact that a Perl interpreter and your code are in the same binary file
is, in this case, a form of mere aggregation.)  This is my interpretation
of the GPL.  If you still have concerns or difficulties understanding
my intent, feel free to contact me.  Of course, the Artistic License
spells all this out for your protection, so you may prefer to use that.

 Note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as this project
 is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not
 v2.2 or v3.x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated.

 HOWEVER, in order to allow a migration to GPLv3 if that seems like
 a good idea, I also ask that people involved with the project make
 their preferences known. In particular, if you trust me to make that
 decision, you might note so in your copyright message, ie something
 like

	This file is licensed under the GPL v2, or a later version
	at the discretion of Linus.

  might avoid issues. But we can also just decide to synchronize and
  contact all copyright holders on record if/when the occasion arises.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.

 .
 2.1. Grants
 .
 Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
 non-exclusive license:
 .
 (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
     Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
     modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
     Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
     as part of a Larger Work; and

     Contributions or its Contributor Version.
 .
 2.2. Effective Date
 .
 The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
 become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
 distributes such Contribution.
 .
 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
 .
 The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
 this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
 distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
 Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
 Contributor:
 .
 (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
     or
 .
 (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
     modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
     Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
     Version); or
 .
 (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
     its Contributions.
 .
 This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
 or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
 the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
 .
 2.4. Subsequent Licenses
 .
 No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
 distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
 License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
 permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
 .
 2.5. Representation
 .
 Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
 Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
 to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
 .
 2.6. Fair Use
 .
 This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
 applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
 equivalents.
 .
 2.7. Conditions
 .
 Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
 in Section 2.1.
 .
 3. Responsibilities
 -------------------
 .
 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
 .
 All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
 Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
 the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
 Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
 License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
 attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
 Form.
 .
 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
 .
 If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
 .
 (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
 .
 (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
 .
 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
 .
 You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
 provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
 the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
 Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
 Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
 License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
 under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
 the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
 Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
 License(s).
 .
 3.4. Notices
 .
 You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
 (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
 or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
 the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
 the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
 .
 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
 .
 You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
 Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
 behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
 such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
 You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
 liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
 disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
 jurisdiction.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
 ---------------------------------------------------
 .
 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
 License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
 statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
 the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
 describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
 be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
 Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
 or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
 recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
 .
 5. Termination
 --------------
 .
 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
 if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
 compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
 Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
 Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
 ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
 non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
 come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
 Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
 notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
 first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
 from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
 Your receipt of the notice.
 .
 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
 infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
 counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
 directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
 You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
 .
 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
 end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
 have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
 prior to termination shall survive termination.
 .

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU compiler
collection, containing Ada, C, C++, Fortran 95, Objective-C,
Objective-C++, and Treelang compilers, documentation, and support
libraries.  In addition, Debian provides the gdc compiler, either in
the same source package, or built from a separate same source package.
Packaging is done by the Debian GCC Maintainers
<debian-gcc@lists.debian.org>, with sources obtained from:

  ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/  (for full releases)
  svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/           (for prereleases)
  http://bitbucket.org/goshawk/gdc     (for D)
  https://github.com/MentorEmbedded/nvptx-newlib/ (for newlib-nvptx)

The current gcc-8 source package is taken from the SVN gcc-8-branch.

Changes: See changelog.Debian.gz

Debian splits the GNU Compiler Collection into packages for each language,
library, and documentation as follows:

Language       Compiler package  Library package    Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ada            gnat-8          libgnat-8          gnat-8-doc
BRIG           gccbrig-8       libhsail-rt0
C              gcc-8                              gcc-8-doc
C++            g++-8           libstdc++6         libstdc++6-8-doc
D              gdc-8
Fortran 95     gfortran-8      libgfortran3       gfortran-8-doc
Go             gccgo-8         libgo0
Objective C    gobjc-8         libobjc2
Objective C++  gobjc++-8

For some language run-time libraries, Debian provides source files,
development files, debugging symbols and libraries containing position-
independent code in separate packages:

Language  Sources      Development   Debugging            Position-Independent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++                                  libstdc++6-8-dbg  libstdc++6-8-pic
D         libphobos-8-dev

Additional packages include:

All languages:
libgcc1, libgcc2, libgcc4       GCC intrinsics (platform-dependent)
gcc-8-base                    Base files common to all compilers
gcc-8-soft-float              Software floating point (ARM only)
gcc-8-source                  The sources with patches

Ada:
libgnatvsn-dev, libgnatvsn8   GNAT version library

C:
cpp-8, cpp-8-doc            GNU C Preprocessor
libssp0-dev, libssp0            GCC stack smashing protection library
libquadmath0                    Math routines for the __float128 type
fixincludes                     Fix non-ANSI header files

C, C++ and Fortran 95:
libgomp1-dev, libgomp1		GCC OpenMP (GOMP) support library
libitm1-dev, libitm1		GNU Transactional Memory Library

Biarch support: On some 64-bit platforms which can also run 32-bit code,
Debian provides additional packages containing 32-bit versions of some
libraries.  These packages have names beginning with 'lib32' instead of
'lib', for example lib32stdc++6.  Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which
can also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names
beginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.  These packages contain 64-bit
versions of the libraries.  (At this time, not all platforms and not all
libraries support biarch.)  The license terms for these lib32 or lib64
packages are identical to the ones for the lib packages.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.

This list documents those licenses which are more restrictive than
a BSD-like license or require the copyright notice

the distribution.  Certain licenses documented here only apply to
specific targets.  Certain clauses only apply if you are building the
code as part of your binary.

Note that this list may omit certain licenses that
only pertain to the copying/modifying of the individual source code. 
If you are distributing the source code, then you do not need to
worry about these omitted licenses, so long as you do not modify the
copyright information already in place.

XZ Utils Licensing

---------------------------------LGPLv2.1 #Start



    Different licenses apply to different files in this package. Here
    is a rough summary of which licenses apply to which parts of this
    package (but check the individual files to be sure!):

      - liblzma is in the public domain.

      - xz, xzdec, and lzmadec command line tools are in the public
        domain unless GNU getopt_long had to be compiled and linked
        in from the lib directory. The getopt_long code is under
        GNU LGPLv2.1+.

      - The scripts to grep, diff, and view compressed files have been
        adapted from gzip. These scripts and their documentation are
        under GNU GPLv2+.

      - All the documentation in the doc directory and most of the
        XZ Utils specific documentation files in other directories
        are in the public domain.

      - Translated messages are in the public domain.

      - The build system contains public domain files, and files that
        are under GNU GPLv2+ or GNU GPLv3+. None of these files end up
        in the binaries being built.

      - Test files and test code in the tests directory, and debugging
        utilities in the debug directory are in the public domain.

      - The extra directory may contain public domain files, and files
        that are under various free software licenses.

    You can do whatever you want with the files that have been put into
    the public domain. If you find public domain legally problematic,
    take the previous sentence as a license grant. If you still find
    the lack of copyright legally problematic, you have too many
    lawyers.

    As usual, this software is provided "as is", without any warranty.

    If you copy significant amounts of public domain code from XZ Utils
    into your project, acknowledging this somewhere in your software is
    polite (especially if it is proprietary, non-free software), but
    naturally it is not legally required. Here is an example of a good
    notice to put into "about box" or into documentation:

        This software includes code from XZ Utils <https://tukaani.org/xz/>.

    The following license texts are included in the following files:
      - COPYING.LGPLv2.1: GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1
      - COPYING.GPLv2: GNU General Public License version 2
      - COPYING.GPLv3: GNU General Public License version 3

    Note that the toolchain (compiler, linker etc.) may add some code
    pieces that are copyrighted. Thus, it is possible that e.g. liblzma
    binary wouldn't actually be in the public domain in its entirety
    even though it contains no copyrighted code from the XZ Utils source
    package.

    If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask the author(s) for more
    information.

		   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions. 

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version. 

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.

matplotlib
---------------------------------matplotlib license #Start
License
Matplotlib only uses BSD compatible code, and its license is based on the PSF license. See the Open Source Initiative licenses page for details on individual licenses. Non-BSD compatible licenses (e.g., LGPL) are acceptable in matplotlib toolkits. For a discussion of the motivations behind the licencing choice, see Licenses.

Copyright Policy
John Hunter began matplotlib around 2003. Since shortly before his passing in 2012, Michael Droettboom has been the lead maintainer of matplotlib, but, as has always been the case, matplotlib is the work of many.

Prior to July of 2013, and the 1.3.0 release, the copyright of the source code was held by John Hunter. As of July 2013, and the 1.3.0 release, matplotlib has moved to a shared copyright model.

matplotlib uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to matplotlib. But, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the matplotlib source code, in its entirety, is not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire matplotlib Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the matplotlib repositories.

The Matplotlib Development Team is the set of all contributors to the matplotlib project. A full list can be obtained from the git version control logs.

ncurses
---------------------------------Ncruses License #Start
Synopsis
The ncurses license evolved in several stages, which are detailed here. Copyright ownership and attribution played important parts in this history.

The Players
In order of appearance

Pavel Curtis (mostly offstage)
Zeyd M. Ben-Halim
Eric S. Raymond
Thomas E. Dickey (narrator, etc).
Juergen Pfeifer
Alexander V. Lukyanov
Keith Bostic
Richard M. Stallman
Florian La Roche
The Stage
Most of the interaction took place on mailing lists:

until early 1997, this was on Zeyd M. Ben-Halim's majordomo mailing list on netcom.
after that (until establishing a mailing list with GNU after the transfer of copyrights to the Free Software Foundation) on a BSDI mailing list provided by Keith Bostic.
Zeyd and I each had shell accounts with ISPs (netcom and clarknet, respectively). We also had ftp areas, which we used to provide files. My access to the nascent Internet was by 56k dialup modem. Zeyd had no webpage, nor did I, initially.

Eric Raymond had a webpage, which referred to an ncurses page. That page was no longer in existence when I looked for it in 1996. Nor did he provide ftp downloads for ncurses. There was intermittent access to the terminfo/termcap files. All of my other interaction with Eric was via email.

Juergen Pfeifer had an ISP account, with a generic webpage. He had no ftp-area.

We exchanged changes using source patches, with occasional tar archives to help synchronization. I uuencoded changes larger than a few lines. Juergen used mime attachments (which were initially a problem, requiring a separate program to decode them). Eric used neither, putting patches inline. Zeyd did not distribute changes via email.

Majordomo provided the ability to moderate the mailing list. More than once, my mail was delayed by several days (rather than a few minutes) during a dispute, prompting me to ask Zeyd if he was moderating it. He stated that he was not. I was the moderator for the ncurses list on BSDI, but did not interfere with the discussion.

Timeline of Events
These examples and discussion use several snapshots of ncurses which I obtained around the time I started maintaining ncurses in April 1996. I used about 40 of these, starting with ncurses 1.8.7 (plus about 20 snapshots of the terminfo database) to build up the "prehistory" of my archive. There was no publicly-accessible archive for the sources, nor was there an archive for the mailing list on netcom.

I had observed that RCS keywords in Eric's patches were passed through untouched into Zeyd's snapshots. From this, I concluded that Zeyd did not use source-control archives of either CVS nor RCS (I use RCS).

I have used the file modification dates, since CHANGES usually did not give a release date.

pcurses – December 1, 1986 (shar archive)
The original pcurses had this notice on each file:

The rlog comments say this notice was added October 25, 1982.

ncurses 0.7.2 – May 22, 1993
While researching for this page, I found 0.7.2 in TAMU-1.0D

There was a binary-only distribution of ncurses 0.7 in Slackware 1.01. While there are scattered announcements, there is no earlier source code to comment upon.

The most noticeable difference between pcurses and ncurses is of course the removal of copyright notices and rlog comments from the C source, putting the "old" and "new" copyright notices in separate files. Here is the "new" copyright notice (timestamp January 24, 1993):

/*********************************************************************

*********************************************************************/
ncurses 1.8.1 – November 5, 1993
This was the first version of ncurses for which I found source code in 1996, e.g., with Slackware 2.0.1.

What I saw in 1996 (and 1997) was that this release was only a little larger than pcurses. The copyright notices (and rlog comments) were removed from each file. The actual copyright notice was in src/COPYRIGHT.NEW, dated September 16, 1993. It differs from the 0.7.2 version by changing the date and disclaiming warranty. The src/COPYRIGHT.OLD file is unchanged, but its timestamp in the 1.8.1 tarball is June 18, 1993.

Aside from adding copyright ownership, and a disclaimer, the permissions granted are identical:

/***************************************************************************

*                                                                          *
***************************************************************************/
Each of the C-source and Awk-source files which made up the library contained a comment pointing the reader to the file containing the copyright notice. The test/example programs had no copyright notice.

ncurses 1.8.1 also included some C++ files, e.g., a panel interface:

Copyright (C) 1993 by Anatoly Ivasyuk
and a curses interface, attributed to Ulrich Drepper. The panel library itself was distributed separately from ncurses.

ncurses 1.8.5 – February 23, 1994
The COPYRIGHT.OLD file is replaced with this:

Pavel Curtis has given up his copyright to the public domain. This mean
his ORIGINAL sources are in the public domain, not this current release.
This current release IS copyrighted, see COPYRIGHT.NEW.
The permissions granted are more elaborate and (noting the "written permission") more restrictive:

/***************************************************************************

***************************************************************************/
Eric Raymond first appears in the CHANGES file. One change, cited for 1.8.3, was related to the problem with color which I pointed out more than a year later:

*) PDCurses seem to assume that wclear() will use current attribute
   when clearing the screen. According to Eric this is not the case
   with SVR4.
The panel library was distributed as part of ncurses with this release.

This release introduced manpages provided by Eric Raymond. In his note, Eric said:

I prepared them by reverse-nroffing the (uncopyrighted) SVr4 curses
man pages with an Emacs package I wrote for the purpose.  I then rewrote
them extensively, removing passive voice, adding many clarifications, and
cleaning up and tightening the language.
Later, I pointed out that large sections of the documentation were identical with SVr4, e.g., as on Solaris.

ncurses 1.8.6 – October 22, 1994
The requirement for attribution was tightened, and "written permission" was dropped:

/***************************************************************************

***************************************************************************/
ncurses 1.9 – April 20, 1995
The copyright notice was updated to add Eric Raymond, who had been involved in development since 1993. Version 1.8.5 (February 23, 1994) lists contributions dating to late 1993.

The permissions were also relaxed, omitting the clause dealing with documentation:

The copyright notice was added to each file that had a comment pointing to COPYRIGHT.NEW.

Most (11 of 13) of the changes documented in the 1.8.8 to 1.8.9 step were my work, unattributed.

ncurses 1.9.1 – May 3, 1995
The CHANGES file does not reflect the changes made. Its only change was to clarify a point regarding PDCurses in the 1.9 fixes made for background color. The ANNOUNCE file gives a hint (covering about 1/3 of the changes made):

New in 1.9.1:
        * Integrated panels support.
        * ncurses output can now be redirected.
No change was made to the copyright notice. However, the two source files for the panel support gave some attribution to its original author.

ncurses 1.9.2 – May 30, 1995
The reason for the release was my work, introducing the configure script. The CHANGES file said only:

*) use 'autoconf' to implement 'configure' script.
Like the test/example programs, the ncurses copyright notice was not applied to my ongoing work with the configure script. My ownership of its copyright was never in serious doubt, though later Eric claimed that he owned it.

According to GNU's Bulletin in June 1995, 1.9.1a was distributed on a GNU tape, as well as nvi. DECUS has a copy of a later tape with 1.9.2d here.

ncurses 1.9.3 – July 12, 1995
The three of us had a short discussion regarding resizeterm starting around the time 1.9.3 was released. Keeping in mind that it had been a full year since my first inconclusive contact with Zeyd, and that I had spent half of that time cleaning up their code, it was time to resume my original goal.

I submitted a patch on July 15 (actually prepared on July 8) to incorporate resizeterm The text was different, and for those files I was listed as the copyright owner:

There were two points of contention. Contemporary readers may focus on the permissions; but that was less unusual in the mid 1990s. The more important aspect was the copyright ownership (both attribution and the ability to grant permissions). At that point, most of my improvements to ncurses were unacknowledged in the CHANGES file (noting that I was credited only with spelling fixes and one patch to address portability for NeXT). For instance,

1.9.2 and 1.9.3 introduced my work on the configure script.
Earlier, 1.8.9 compiler-warning fixes, etc., were my work.
The changes for wkbgd in 1.8.8 were the result of my report, followup with testing ncurses versus Solaris curses. (I could have sent a patch, but at that time thought that I could move on after getting resizeterm integrated).
However, rather than arguing or discussing the language of the copyright, Zeyd and Eric both asserted that their copyright notice had to be used, without change. After a few messages back and forth, Eric cc'd me on a message to Zeyd, saying that while the copyright notice was not negotiable, that they might allow me to have my name on the files. The tone of that email, in particular the word allow was unnecessarily rude. It was clear from the context that their names would be on the copyright notice, that the allow referred to an "author" comment found in many files, separated from the copyright notice.

Eric's comments terminated the discussion.

The wording of the permissions, by the way, was that which I used initially in 1994 to take into account the agreement which I had with my employer delineating this type of activity. From their standpoint, "as long as no money is involved", they were unconcerned. When asked politely (as in the case of diffstat), I would agree to accommodate the request.

ncurses 1.9.4 – August 11, 1995
This release began integrating Juergen Pfeifer's libraries (the menu library first), with no change to the copyright notice.

Each of the C-source files added bore the same copyright notice. Juergen's name was not on any of those files. He was listed as author in the supporting documentation, including manpages.

As with the previous inclusion of manpages, Eric wrote the manpages using SVr4 documentation as a basis. In this release, there was no claim that those were uncopyrighted.

ncurses 1.9.5 – September 11, 1995
ncurses 1.9.6 – October 13, 1995
This release finished adding Juergen's libraries, i.e., the form library.

It also added tset, which was mostly (70% according to my analysis in 2009) copied without change from 4.4 BSD. In this case, the Regent's copyright is also used.

ncurses 1.9.7a – November 10, 1995
The two "a" releases 1.9.7a and 1.9.8a were issued because Zeyd released 1.9.7 and 1.9.8 without checking if they built successfully. I reported the problems with both, and was told it was "too late".

ncurses 1.9.8a – December 9, 1995
ncurses 1.9.9 – February 13, 1996
This release added one new file using the ncurses copyright. It was ncurses/lib_resize.c.

That was the result of a collaboration between Eric Raymond and Ken Hollis. Ken would write the code and Eric would use it. At least that's the way it was presented by Raymond in email, first privately on January 6th and then on the mailing list on the 12th.

Ken Hollis was in the process of writing a small library named winlib, which approached resizing in a different way. The code that Eric Raymond added to ncurses was based on reading the patch which I had made (at this writing, noting the similarity of the logic), and extending that to handle subwindows. I had already pointed Ken Hollis to my patch on December 26, 1995, and Eric Raymond had more than once read the patch.

Likewise, the accompanying manpage was based on the manpage which I had written. To make his point clear, Raymond added a paragraph which explicitly claimed originality:

This call was designed for ncurses(3x), and is not found in SVr4 curses, 4.4BSD curses, or any other previous version of curses. It is recommended that you conditionalize all code depending on it with the symbol NCURSES.

In either case (whoever was the programmer), it was plagiarism. The manpage was written by Eric Raymond.

While I was considering my next step, I happened upon an amusing incident related to this. My usual practice in inspecting an ncurses snapshot was to build it, and link my programs against it. I overlooked applying my patch, and since it built, did not immediately notice that I was using the unpatched ncurses version. My program dumped core. I investigated (using ElectricFence) and found three places in the code which indexed one cell too far. I informed Eric that I had found that his version would dump core. After a few emails, he had not taken the time to investigate. As I told him (on the mailing list, February 28):

I traced the core dump down to an error in your version of wresize (it's a fine point of etiquette, but you'll have to analyze and fix it).

ncurses 1.9.9a – March 4, 1996
ncurses 1.9.9b – March 6, 1996
ncurses 1.9.9c – March 12, 1996
The TO-DO file was modified to note

* The wresize() code has been reported to core-dump occasionally.  The
  maintainers haven't been able to reproduce this.
ncurses 1.9.9d – March 17, 1996
ncurses 1.9.9e – March 24, 1996
This marked the end of Zeyd's maintainership of ncurses. It was still his mailing list, but it was the last release that he prepared, and he made only minor contributions past that point.

The release introduced a bug in the form library; it did not refresh.

I decided at this point that I would no longer send patches to Eric or Zeyd:

I had done more than half of the total work on ncurses during the past year.
I had more than once done the fixes to repair a broken release.
There was that matter of plagiarism.
As a matter of practice, this meant that I would send only patch announcements to the mailing list. Patches would be accessible on my ftp area, at ClarkNet.

I made a collection of all of the available snapshots of ncurses, and sorted them by date, checked in sequentially to build a "prehistory" for an archive to start development.

April 6, 1996
This was the first patch against my ncurses archive. In addition to the C files, I began updating the NEWS file. The ncurses NEWS file has been the changelog since release 1.9.4 in 1995, replacing the older CHANGES file.

Unlike Zeyd, I chose to date each patch, in the NEWS file.
Further, I would cite each contributor in the NEWS file.
However, I had no intention of providing releases.
The point of maintaining my own archive was to compel Eric and Zeyd (by competition or whatever motivation) to make their version of ncurses better.

However, there was no follow-up version from Zeyd. I collected some of Eric's patches from the mailing list over the next month before he reoriented himself and decided that my archive was his official repository.

For instance, Eric's patch #294 on April 4 included fixes by Juergen for the form library. In email (April 1, 1996), Juergen sent a patch, reporting

due to a change in the wsyncup() routine in module lib_window.c the form and menu code is broken. Because the fix in wsyncup() is correct, I've to provide this small patch which fixes the problems. Obviously next time we have to better synchronize our cross-testing before we release.

Juergen amended that (April 3, 1996):

Hi Eric,

yes, you applied it correctly, but unfortunately I forgot to
mail also the patch that is necessary for ncurses/lib_window.c,
where the implementation of wsyncup() and wsyncdown() has
changed for 1.9.9 and is terribly broken.

At least after you apply this patch, you may drop my last
patch for form and menu. It doesn't harm, but it is unnecessary
defensive programming and may affect performance.

This is the patch for lib_window.c

Regards
Juergen
May 1996
Philippe De Muyter suggested that I also note who reported a problem; I began recording these as "requested by", "reported by", etc., noting that "requested by" carries the connotation of whose idea the change was.

One long-running dispute which began in May 1996 was regarding the hashmap feature to improve scrolling performance. Eric added it in his patch #301, which I applied in late May. His email noted

ncurses/hashmap.c:
        New file.  It's included after the patch band.  Use a modified
        Heckel algorithm on line hashes to fill in scramble-vector
        information based on the old and new screen contents,
"Heckel" refers to (CACM-3114 April 1978). As an aside, see Paul Heckel's 1992 article Debunking the Software Patent Myths.

However when I measured it, rather than improving performance, the result was often slower, typically 5-20%.

I added the source, but after measuring it, ifdef'd it out.

June 1996
Acting as the maintainer, I was able to see first-hand Eric's changes before they were applied. Much of Eric's work was poor-quality.

One example that I recall clearly was that in July/August, he sent 6 successive patches for the terminfo.src file—5 of those were defective.

Also (though he usually cited contributions in the accompanying email), Eric's suggested updates for the NEWS file were almost all for his own work. Initially, I had thought that Eric and Zeyd would update their site and construct the NEWS file according to their own tastes. In my version, I listed Eric's patches, adding highlights (but not all features) to NEWS. In reviewing email to obtain the information for this page, I have updated NEWS to reflect the accompanying email as well.

Reviewing one patch in June, I had just spent some late nights fixing a previous patch of his. I wrote to Eric, advising him that I would not put his patch in that week, because I could see problems with it.

Eric replied, saying

You have no right to do this,
for I am an author of ncurses,
and you are not.

On that occasion, I gave in (I did the work to fix the patch). Additionally, I continued to correct his patches through November 1996.

However, I did not give in on the hashmap code. That issue was finally resolved by Alexander V. Lukyanov in 1997. Because of the substantial improvements he made, Alexander is arguably the primary author of this feature; without those improvements it would not be part of ncurses today. In terms of total contribution to ncurses since 1996, Alexander ranks fourth, immediately after Eric.

September 7, 1996
I fixed one of the problems in 1.9.9:

960907  - snapshot
        + replaced Eric's imitation of wresize with my original (his didn't
          work).
This patch used the MIT X11 license, which I was using with xterm:

October 1996
Juergen sent email with the Ada95 binding. I was initially unable to compile this (although I was familiar with Ada, the available compiler did not work), and did not immediately add it to my snapshots. Eric was unfamiliar with Ada. Zeyd objected to its inclusion (in our discussion of ncurses 1.9.g on November 30):

I would also like to package non-C support seperately. The Ada binding increase
the size and complexity of the package, but are unneeded by the overwhelming
majority of ncurses users. We now have C++, Ada, Modula-2, and FORTRAN interfaces.
At the time, I was undecided, suggesting that separate packages might work. Juergen argued against that, pointing out that it increased "only slightly".

The Ada95 binding also had Juergen's copyright notice, based on the wording used by Eric and Zeyd. Here is a sample:

November 1996
ncurses 1.9.9g – November 30, 1996
I released ncurses 1.9.9g.

The version number itself had been suggested by Zeyd in discussion July 3rd. He had started to apply patches, attempting to resync against my changes. There were some problems with it; I did not see a followup. As I commented in email to a user September 14:

So at the moment we're sort of at an impasse: I'm not going to do an official
release until Zeyd does something about the credits, and he's not going to
do anything, because he's not feeling that he's in control - but wants to be.
Probably what'll happen will be that he discontinues his mailing list (that's
the easy solution - he could issue another broken release).  After the past
few years, I doubt that the graceful solution will occur to him (I've been
working on it intermittently since December 1993, but fairly consistently
for two years - it supports another of my projects).
and on the 16th:

(When Zeyd last emailed me in mid-July, it was to tell me about a "1.9.9g"
version - but he was still ~30k of diffs away from my version -- and his
wouldn't work, because some of the diffs were pieces of bugs.  So I told
him there was no point in discussing it until he got in sync - I assume he's
sulking).
The technical goal for the release was to mark a stable point before modifying the versioning to work with the latest Linux dynamic loader. Juergen had reported in mid-November

I just installed the newest dynamic linker ld.so.1.8.5 on my
Linux box. It appears that this version no longer accepts that
a shared library file that is not a symbolic link can have a
name different from its soname. So, our current construct

    libblabla.so.1.9.9g   is the real file
    libblabla.so.3.3      is the symbolic link

no longer works, it must be the vice versa relation.
The proposed solution was to bump both numbers up to 4. But we could not do just that because there had been no recent stable release for users to migrate from.

The release itself was by agreement between me, Zeyd and Juergen, in response to Eric's repeated demands for a release, as well as repeated threats to "hijack" the project. From email, I see that Eric started demanding a release in May 1996, repeated in July, September, October and November. The threats to hijack the project started in September. He also demanded a copy of my bug-list, which I declined. As I noted in email to Juergen:

You might find this interesting (I did send Eric a copy of my bug list

longer by introducing more bugs -- so I'm rather reluctant to add to my
overhead).

Forwarded message:
Here is my email advising Zeyd and Juergen of the upcoming release, which I cc'd to the mailing list. Zeyd, who perhaps did not notice that it was sent to the mailing list, forwarded the email to Eric, whose most recent threat to hijack the project was on the preceding day:

I'm putting together this week's snapshot as a formal release of 1.9.9g
As I discussed before, there's a few issues that should be cleared up
before 2.0.0, however much it irritates Eric

        + the shared library versioning reported by Juergen (this is fairly
          simple to work on)

        + the resizing via endwin/refresh (if I don't get dumped on, that'll
          take a week or two with my current timing).

        + check on the scrolling bug that I observed, and decide when/what
          to do about it (I'm reluctant to make fast changes: _all_ of the
          optimizer changes that have been given to me by Alex or Eric have
          had bugs in them - some minor, some subtle & nasty -- I don't have
          time to fix Eric's patches just now).

I've completed my regression builds for ncurses 1.9.9g (a couple of minor
fixes since last night).  It's available in

        ftp.clark.net:/pub/dickey/ncurses/ncurses-1.9.9g.tgz

and will probably be in Zeyd's directory soon (I put a copy in his incoming
directory).

(this is an interim release - further changes are planned)

dickey@clark.net
At the same time, I added the same MIT-X11 copyright notice to the 37 remaining files for which I was the author, e.g., the configure script, makefiles, as well as some of the source code, such as test.priv.h.

December 1996
On December 20, Eric Raymond asserted in email that 1.9.9g had not been announced on the mailing list (see above).

Not much else from his comments are of interest, since they were merely a rehash of previous verbal attacks.

ncurses 4.0 – December 24, 1996
The release of ncurses 4.0 was done to solve a technical issue. As noted before, I released 1.9.9g at the end of November, 1996 to provide a stable basis for the proposed 4.0 release.

Zeyd for instance suggested bumping the ABI to 4.0 and the release version to match, in email to me and Eric on September 24, even before the problem with ld.so.1.8.5 surfaced. At the time, Eric disagreed with the proposal to bump the ABI version. I forwarded the mail to Michael Alan Dorman (the Debian package maintainer for ncurses), noting that there already had been ABI breakage due to some of Eric's changes. No resolution was made at that point; email from Zeyd on November 18 still echoes that conversation. Eric's reply to Zeyd at that point included this:

> I'm still tempted to move the whole release to 4.0 and avoid all the hassle
> with sonames. a link from libncurses.3.5 -> libncurses.4.0 can provide
> backward compatibility since the changes are actually very limited.

I have no particular opinion about this.  I don't see how changing to 4.0
would buy us anything, but with this link it wouldn't break anything either.
Where's the gain?

Fair warning -- if you disappear down a hole again, I'm going to issue
a public release myself.  This is not to ace you out or anything, but
you've been virtually incommunicado since 1.9.9e. I don't think I've
seen four pieces of email from you since.  And people are banging down
my door trying to get a release schedule out of us.  In case you've missed
it, most of the Linuxes are ncurses-based now, and the BSD people want to
switch over on our next release.
Zeyd replied to my mail regarding 1.9.9g (cc'ing Eric), proposing that we release 4.0:

>I'm putting together this week's snapshot as a formal release of 1.9.9g
>As I discussed before, there's a few issues that should be cleared up
>before 2.0.0, however much it irritates Eric
>
>       + the shared library versioning reported by Juergen (this is fairly

Which I would like to fix via moving to 4.0.0 and keep the ABI_VERSION equal
to VERSION from now on. This will allow us to clean out any deadwood.

libncurses.so -> libncurses.so.4
libncurses.so.4 -> libncurses.so.4.0.0
A later email from Zeyd dated December 4 proposed a release date

I haven't actually looked at the contents, but I'm not inclined
to include the second part in post-1.9.9g. I'm sure it can wait
for post-4.0.0. Frankly, apart from fixes to docs, very few fixes
should be incorporated prior to release of 4.0.0. The weekend
before Xmas seems like a good point to shoot for (so users can
fill their stockings :-)
The problem with the shared libraries was becoming a nuisance, forcing a short timeline. My email to the mailing list on December 9 summarized the situation:

When I was testing, I did notice that ld.so 1.8.5 was able to _run_ the
programs, but ldconfig doesn't show the libraries in the resulting listing.  I
suppose they'll hobble along, whimpering.

probably right around Christmas, unless someone derails me -- I've got
to finish off a change that I started on Saturday, and do some more testing.

Thomas E. Dickey
dickey@clark.net
I proceeded, paring down the critical bugs, and on December 24 was ready to package a release. However, there were a few problems to consider: how to resolve the issue of credits, and how to ensure a timely release:

For the first, it was certain that if I simply handed the work over to Zeyd, then the resulting NEWS file would be reworded, reducing and/or eliminating mention of non-authors.
As a rule, I have not added my name to each entry of the NEWS file, since (as primary developer and maintainer) it would be very cluttered. Later (before 4.2) I added the disclaimer at the top to address this. I do add my initials for changes to the terminfo.src file. But my name does appear in other contexts, and there are the other contributors to consider.

My ftp area was not sufficient to support a release of ncurses and ongoing work, so it needed a good home.
Zeyd (ignoring the three-month absence) was responding to email. But in spite of several commenting that he was putting a patched version together, I saw no result.
Given that, I saw no reason to expect that the "authoritative" version would be released soon.

Reflecting on these issues, I prepared an upload to the sunsite ftp server. Their format called for an ".lsm" (Linux Software Map) file. The ".lsm" file included fields for developer and maintainer.

I added my name, and Juergen's to the developers, and listed them alphabetically:

Zeyd Ben-Halim
Thomas Dickey
Eric S. Raymond
Juergen Pfeifer
For maintainer, I listed myself (since it was my work), and added Juergen Pfeifer. I added Juergen's name for two reasons:

like myself, there was a lot of code in ncurses which had Eric's and Zeyd's names on it, which Juergen had written.
he was more responsive in email, producing almost as much as Eric, but invariably well-considered and polite.
I did still list Zeyd's ftp area as the primary site, and added my own. I also removed Eric's ftp area because it had no ncurses files.

The timing also came into play, since that was still in time for Christmas.

Perhaps (if I had not run short of time), I might have sent mail to Juergen and Zeyd in advance. However, the first email that I have from that time is the one advising Erik Troan that I had uploaded a release of ncurses, and that Zeyd would be making some announcement soon, to make it official.

Here is an archive of the discussion.

As noted in the discussion, some mail was lost by the mailing list. I have used my "sent" file for instance when my mail to the list did not come back to me.

Eric and Zeyd announced that they were preparing a release to replace ncurses 4.0, but nothing ever came of that.

January 1997
I keep mail archives in six-month intervals. The first half of 1997 had more than twice as much ncurses email as the preceding six months. Most of the increase is due to the conflict.

I continued to make weekly patch announcements (and Alexander, Juergen and I continued developing), but most of the mail dealt with politics.

On January 3, 1997, Zeyd requested that I remove ncurses 4.0 from my ftp area. I said "no", then upon being asked

Gee, thanks a lot! Would you like to be more cryptic? Are you simply tring to
hijack the ncurses project before Eric does?
I elaborated, giving my position. In our replies, we each cc'd Juergen and Eric. Juergen followed up with

Maybe I'm an ignorant, but could you please explain what hijacking of the
ncurses project means to you ? Wouldn't "adopting the ncurses orphan" be
a more proper term ?
Eric's response was to make an (unspecified) threat.

Keith Bostic had offered to help. At this point, I suggested to Keith that we (including Juergen) discuss how to continue the ncurses project. I picked up on an earlier offer of a separate mailing list, and possibly a new home for its ftp area. He agreed to help.

After some discussion, Juergen approached Zeyd to better explain the situation. Zeyd (and Eric) did not respond until a week had passed (January 18). Eric announced that no upload to sunsite would be accepted without his approval. Zeyd (due to work pressure) was not eager to continue with ncurses.

Replying to Zeyd, I wrote:

> any more bullshit. If Tom wants to be responsible for maintaining releases he
> can be my guest. If Eric wants to take over, he too is welcome.
We would like to move the mailing list, if you're not interested in maintaining
it anymore.  May I have a copy of your list?
Zeyd replied on the 21st, sending a list of subscribers. I started talking to Keith's chief admin at BSDI (Kelly Alexander) on the 23rd. Due to various technical problems, the list was not set up immediately.

In the meantime, bickering continued on the mailing list.

On the 29th, Keith Bostic suggested that we talk on the telephone to discuss the problems with ncurses. I called him, and we talked for more than an hour. Keith had several comments to make, and suggested that I send mail to Eric outlining my position in detail.

Eric's reply was three times as long. One of the principal areas of disagreement was the role of the project maintainer. From my point of view, the attributes that he used for that overlapped with the alternative (which he said I was doing), called project librarian. The overall tone was more polite, but the end result was the same as before: Eric was the only suitable choice for being the maintainer, and it would be nice if I continued as the project librarian.

I discussed this reply with Keith, who suggested that I make a counter offer, where the project maintainership would be co-owned between us. I followed up first with Juergen, who had some concerns about Eric's proposal to be the project coordinator (maintainer), if we had no rules about which circumstances would be appropriate for Eric's overriding the others.

I started my ncurses FAQ at this point (see original dated January 31, 1997), and responded that evening:

Rather than respond point by point, I'll be brief.  My proposal (which is what
Keith & I discussed this week) is that we organize this as equal partners in
respect to discussion of release targets, design issues.  (His term is 'board
of directors').  Discussion of this nature would be separate from the mailing
list - but in a polite manner nonetheless.

I would continue to maintain the source archive, as I have been doing,
integrating patches that look stable enough for public beta, tracking
problems that have been reported.
Incidentally, I considered my phrasing about the “pun” to be awkward wording. However, I have noticed others quoting me on that, e.g., in the ncurses howto written several years later.

February 1997
I received no reply to that; the bickering continued.

A user reported on the 14th that 1.9.9g was no longer available from Zeyd's ftp area (it was a zero-length file). I remarked to Juergen on the 19th that Red Hat was distributing ncurses 4.0 with my patches through February 9. Shortly after (on the 21st), I noted that 1.9.9g was no longer on sunsite. There were about 30 downloads a day of ncurses from my ftp area.

March 1997
I noted in email to Juergen on the 8th that Zeyd had replaced the 1.9.9g on his ftp area on the 26th. Also, the new mailing list was still not setup properly. There had been some suggestion of uploading the next release of ncurses to prep.ai.mit.edu (the old GNU site), though that was still in the future.

On the 27th, Juergen told me that 1.9.9g was on prep.ai.mit.edu. Immediately after that, Zeyd emailed me, asking what plans I had for 4.1.

April 1997
The new mailing list finally worked. I subscribed to it (ncurses@bsdi.com) on the 9th. The first regular email was on the 12th. I updated the subscribers list (155 total).

May 1997
At the beginning of May, Zeyd wrote that he was having trouble shutting down the old mailing list, or providing forwarding. I replied that I was nearly ready to release 4.1.

At the same time, I applied a patch from Juergen which changed the copyright owner for the form and menu libraries to him. This made the wording consistent with the notices which I used. Here is a sample:

/*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Juergen did not change the notices in the Ada95 binding, which was inconsistent. However, this change made the copyright notices fairly evenly split between Eric and Zeyd on one part, and me and Juergen on the other.

ncurses 4.1 – May 15, 1997
After a couple of false starts, ncurses 4.1 was ready for release.

More than one person suggested uploading it to prep.ai.mit.edu. Following up got this result:

Karl, could you please put the latest ncurses on prep?
After that, things were quiet for a couple of weeks, until I responded to a terminfo update on the old mailing list. Eric responded to my comment. This is the first of several emails, all of about the same flavor:

Someone did remove the file from prep.ai.mit.edu. Apparently a different someone followed up to Eric's missive, making RMS aware of the issue. His first response was on May 30:

Having seen only one side of the story, I don't know Dickey did, or
whether it was illegal or even uncool.  But there are certain general
things I can say for certain:

1. The copyright holders of ncurses cannot retroactively deny any
party the right to change and distribute ncurses in accord with the
distribution terms that are published on it.  A freedom which can be
summarily taken away is no freedom at all.

2. If someone has violated these distribution terms, that's a
different matter, since that is doing something for which permission
was never given.

3. None of you is authorized to delete files from prep.ai.mit.edu.

If I believe that ncurses 4.1 was made illegally, or if I conclude
that it's not good for the community, I'll stop the FSF's distribution
of it.  But I am going to judge this for myself, after hearing both
sides.
There were about 300 emails from the ncurses mailing lists over the next day. There was also a thread on Debian developer mailing list, but I was not invited. Debian had been distributing a package based on 1.9.9g, labeling it as "3.4", with the expectation that 4.1 would resolve enough issues to make "3.4" obsolete. Debian developers were notable for discussing the issue at length without questioning any detail of Eric's account of the situation.

June 1997
At the time, I discarded the uninteresting ones (and some, such as the thread in which Eric was discredited when he claimed that I had no copyright on my code because I "gave" it to him). Interestingly, there are few comments on the flamewar, aside from those by the Debian ncurses package maintainer Michael Alan Dorman here and here.

Most of what I discarded however, was simple "me-too" attacks.

However, one of those elaborated an interpretation of the ncurses license which caught RMS's attention. RMS wrote:

I just checked the ncurses distribution terms, and was very surprised:
they *do not* give permission for distribution of modified versions.

I had assumed ncurses was free software because "everyone knew" it".
I was under the impression that ncurses was derived from some BSD
software and was distributed under the same terms as BSD.  I should
have checked the distribution terms when the FSF first considered
distributing ncurses.  I am sorry I failed to do that.

Unfortunately, this means that ncurses is not free software.
The freedom to distribute modified versions, including changes that
the author does not like, is a crucial aspect of free software.

As a result, it is indeed forbidden for Dickey, or any of us, to
distribute modified versions.  So I deleted ncurses 4.1 from prep.

I also deleted the other versions of ncurses from prep, because the
FSF exists to develop and distribute free software only.  Distributing
a non-free program, even if legally permitted, does not advance our
mission.

The free software community is now in a hole.  We need a good free
curses package for free operating systems, and the one we thought we
had, we do not have.  I can see three possible ways we can come up
with one:

* ESR and Zeyd together can agree to permit distribution of modified
versions and thus make ncurses free software.

* Someone can write a new program which is free software.  Perhaps
some of Dickey's code, and other recent contributors' code, can be
used as part of this.

* There may be another good alternative, or at least one that is
better than nothing.  Does anyone know?

The first way is best.  Perhaps it is possible.  ESR spoke of
transferring ncurses to the FSF.  If both ESR and Zeyd are willing to
say yes to this, and understand that we would have to change the
distribution terms and thus make ncurses free software, then the FSF
will say yes to it.
In subsequent discussion, Eric more than once insisted that his and Zeyd's copyrights were the only relevant ones, and that mine (and Juergen's) were irrelevant. RMS responded to Eric, cc'ing Keith, me, Juergen and Zeyd:

Subject: Re: ncurses 4.1

    Not true.  See Kaz Kylheku's analysis of this point, and Richard
    Stallman's conclusions upon analyzing the ncurses license language.
    Zeyd's and my wishes are the only ones legally relevant.

Perhaps there is a misunderstanding; that is not what I meant to imply.

Although you and Zeyd are the only people whose names mentioned in the
copyright notice, that does not mean you two are the only copyright
holders.  In fact, each contributor holds the copyright to his own
work, unless he has assigned it or disclaimed it.

Whether you have the right to use other contributors' work, or they
yours, I don't know.  I do know that it is a complicated question.
One of the reasons why the FSF asks for legal papers from all
contributors is to eliminate uncertainty about whether we can use
their contributions.
Just before that, RMS sent private email to me:

I don't blame you for feeling angry, but expressing anger to Eric may
be counterproductive.  He may be less likely to agree to make *his*
work free software if he dwells on the conflict between you.

So I would suggest that you not post on the list for a while,
hoping that Eric will calm down and agree.
I complied with that request, limiting my comments (other than patch notices) to private email.

In the followup discussion, several people suggested relicensing ncurses, and perhaps adding a neutral third person to be the project lead:

Jason Evans suggested assigning copyrights to a third party but did not address the issue of the project lead.
Florian La Roche went a little further, suggesting himself as a possible maintainer.
Keith Bostic picked up on Jason Evans comments in private email to me and Eric, cc'ing Jason Evans and RMS on June 3:
Given that Jason has the time and inclination to work on a
curses project, would he be a possible choice as an FSF person
to shepherd the ncurses project forward?

Eric, you've said that you'd be willing to have a neutral 3rd
party head the project.  Jason hasn't worked with either you or
Tom in the past, and he believes he has the time and background
to bring himself up to speed quickly.

Tom, Eric, would you consider the following:

    + Jason takes responsibility for moderating the patches
      and releases of ncurses.  He owns taking patches from all
      interested parties, coordinating people's efforts,
      deciding issues about which there is contention, and
      making releases.  I'll sign up to help him when he wants
      me to.

    + Put a Berkeley-style copyright on the sources (Eric is
      unwilling to use the LGPL).

    + We jointly ensure that the source code acknowledgements
      are correct and up-to-date.

    + The four main contributors to ncurses assign their copyright
      in ncurses to the FSF.
I replied to Keith Bostic that it sounded reasonable. Eric referred to it in the mailing list, implying a more active role than was apparent.

Keith Bostic emailed the four ncurses developers (me, Eric, Juergen and Zeyd) recapping the progress, and stating that both Eric and I had agreed in principle to let a neutral third party manage the project. He listed three who were apparently willing. Licensing was the more important aspect of the mail; Eric had not yet agreed to changing the license to permit modification and redistribution. Keith wanted to know if there was any problem with the other developers with either BSD or LGPL.

I replied that I had been using a BSD-style license.

Jason Evans pointed out that ncurses itself was a derivative work of pcurses. I replied to Jason privately:

Zeyd has asserted that he received permission (that Pavel declared it
public domain).  I've never seen any email from Pavel.
Zeyd replied to the list.

According to Adam Richter of Yggdrasil, Pavel Curtis released his work in
pcurses into the public domain. Up until that point I included his copyright
notice and a copyright notice to cover my own work. Thomas was not involved
with ncurses at the time and is not privy what happened before he did. It is
kinda late for him to question events. All of a sudden people are coming
out the woodwork claiming that ncurses is not free because they were not aware
of the copyright! The main purpose of the copyright is to prevent others from
taking ncurses, modifying it, and then releasing it as their own work.
I believe QNX include a modified copy of ncurses, but nobody is complaining
becuase they are not misrepresenting it as their own work.
As I previously noted, after 1.9.9e I had collected copies of all extent versions of ncurses as well as pcurses. My comments have been based on email from Eric and Zeyd as well as the source code as it evolved. At the time, I read Zeyd's reply as no more than confirming that the public domain status of pcurses was second hand information.

Zeyd's comment about "included his copyright" on the other hand requires quantification.
Here is a table showing counts of copyright and attribution (the author's name) in source and documentation for each release through 4.2:

Release	Copyright	Attribution
FSF	Pavel	Zeyd	Eric	Thomas	Juergen	Pavel	Zeyd	Eric	Thomas	Juergen

Notes on the table:

As noted, Eric's involvement predated ncurses 1.8.5, when the Pavel's copyright notice was removed. The more elaborate notice in each file dated from the beginning of Eric's fulltime involvement with the project. Zeyd found some issue with my summary of ncurses history, but did not respond to my direct questions asking where the disagreement lay. The email quoted above is the only polite one mentioning the issue.
Zeyd here stated that he was working on ncurses in 1991. The copyrights say 1992 for the earliest date.
The earlier FSF copyrights were for the cursesw.cc file, and the configure script. My older archives (until ncurses 5.5, when I changed my strategy for regression builds) did not tag the related config.guess and config.sub files.
As part of development of cursesw.cc, it had been rewritten, so (while its copyright has "always" been FSF), the license was changed for conformity with ncurses.
I started writing the autoconf-based configure script in May 1995. The first release containing this (and the reworked makefiles, etc) was ncurses 1.9.2. The NEWS file did mention this change; none of the comments credit me with the work. I see 27 items in the NEWS file mentioning my work (through ncurses 1.9.9e), 2 are attributed to me.
There was an earlier configure script, which Eric wrote. But it was unsatisfactory, requiring the developers to maintain a matrix of all possible #defines (host versus definition). Eric may have been referring to that, though it did not occur to me at the time. We had not used it for more than two years.
After 1.9.9e, unmarked items in NEWS are noted to be my own work, reducing clutter.
When releasing ncurses 1.9.9g, I added my copyright notice to the configure script and makefiles.
Copyrights by Eric and Zeyd were for the same files; Eric had copyrighted in addition the test/ncurses.c file.
Attributions for Eric increased noticeably at 1.9.7a because starting at that point the terminfo.src file was bundled with ncurses. Eric initialed many changes in that file.
Copyrights for Eric and Zeyd dropped at ncurses 4.1 because Juergen asserted his copyright.
Attributes for both Eric and Zeyd increased with ncurses 4.2, because the scripts which I developed for changing the copyright notices added "Author" comments to replace the copyright notices which were removed.
Copyright notices for 4.2 covered the files which had RCS identifiers, e.g., were not generated.
I contacted Pavel that evening to get his input on its copyright status. He replied

I am the author.  I make no claims whatsoever to ownership of the code, to
rights to any credit (monetary or otherwise) for its use, or to its legal
or technical fitness for any purpose.  Basically, from my point of view,
you should treat it as completely free "found" code.  Enjoy.
The following day (June 5), I clarified in mail a reply to RMS, cc'ing Juergen and Keith, a forward of Pavel's email:

> If it is true that ncurses still includes material derived from
> pcurses, then we would need to have Pavel's permission for its use.
>
> However, if he gave permission for the use of this material in ncurses
> some time ago, that permission may be sufficient.  It depends on the
> details of the permission that was given.
>
> Also, if he sees our situation, and he thinks that our plans for
> ncurses are a reasonable way of handling the situation, he may extend
> the permission that he gave previously.
I sent email to Pavel last night (having gotten a current address via
DejaNews), and he has no problems with that.  Jason was misinterpreting my
statement of distaste (for the removal of the original author's name from
files rather than citing the author in the copyright notice), as opposed to
a claim that they'd violated his legal rights).
Following this short burst at the beginning of June 1997, almost all of the licensing related mail was private. There were occasional queries from users directed to the mailing list, but again, my replies were private.

For instance, on the 13th it seems that I was the only one who responded to a request from RMS for a list of contributors:

So can people please put together a complete list of everyone who
contributed to ncurses, and classify them into major and minor
contributors?

The major contributors are people who wrote more than 10% (roughly) or
who contributed entire new files.  Others are minor contributors.

People who contributed less than 20 lines can be omitted from the
list, since we don't want to ask them for papers.
Replying, I pointed out that there were six major contributors (Pavel Curtis and Warren Tucker as well as the then-current four), with only two active developers. From the NEWS file I listed 16 minor contributors.

In a later message (on August 24, to RMS and Florian), I reported data from RCS logs. The data showed that:

9 of the minor contributors could be discarded.
Juergen and I had done most of the changes (he had added more new code, while I had made more changes to existing code).
Most of Eric's changes were modifications to existing code; he had done less in that area than Juergen. He ranked third on that list.
Unexpectedly, from that data it was apparent that Alexander was a major contributor, ranking fourth.
For the period where I had data, Zeyd was a minor contributor, between H.J. Lu and Philippe De Muyter.
All of the minor contributors together totaled less than one percent of the changes.
My list was not the final one. Reviewing the various lists in 2011, I see that:

Warren Tucker (original author of the panel library) was categorized as a minor contributor.
Some of the contributors who had not met the 15-line threshold (and who were not mentioned in any of the usual places such as NEWS, README or terminfo.src files) were listed in email from RMS on September 24 as minor contributors.
For my own reference, I made a table. Here are counts from that table.

I had listed 16 contributors from the NEWS file (other than the 4 main developers), and then showed data from RCS logs to reduce that to 7.
23 minor contributors were given in the final list on September 19.
my data overlooked two of these, but on reexamination, it appears that they probably did not meet the 15-line (or later 20-line) limit.
4 of the contributors who I listed as not meeting the 15-line limit were nonetheless in the final list.
one is listed, though the only contribution on record was a flawed patch that I had reworked to make it usable.
another was marginal, providing 17 lines of changes.
the README file appears to be the source for 6 others. One contributor is mentioned there, but there is nowhere an indication that they provided code or documentation.
Given that, the list might have been pruned to 14. As an added complication, three of the minor contributors would in other situations be regarded as major contributors (one with more than 2500 lines of change, and two with more than 1000).

At the end of June, I pointed out to RMS and Keith that there was a problem with the terminfo.src file versus ncurses. I had noticed that Eric was preparing an update which was flawed in more than one way.

July 1997
After some discussion, I made my point that it was unreasonable to expect ncurses to be independent of Eric unless its copy of the terminfo.src file was also independent. The ncurses maintainer would have to deal with technical issues (which I noted at the time).

In concluding that discussion, RMS said in part:

When Florian takes over as ncurses maintainer, he will maintain the
copy of the terminfo data base that's included in ncurses.  You don't
have to pay attention to the copy of the terminfo data base that Eric
distributes.
We had not completely solved the problem, because I continued doing almost all of the technical work related to ncurses. But a policy had been established.

Florian was very busy (with work for SuSE, and later with a new child). I have a half-dozen replies in my mail archive for July 1997, one for August, another half-dozen for September, none for October or November, two for December. There are several from January and February 1998, when I was preparing the actual release. But in practice (aside from fending off requests to do releases) my activities were not very different from the preceding six months.

In mid-July RMS asked for status, and I told him that I was waiting for Florian, but was willing to spend time, e.g., review, integrate, test. RMS asked Florian, who replied that he was waiting for confirmation from Zeyd, and also that he was in the process of updating the license notice in each file. His mail said "40%", which gave me the impression that he was editing the files, rather than scripting the process (Florian and I had discussed scripting this, starting on June 20, and I also suggested copyrite).

Florian also attached "the currently used copyright terms" (the ncurses license, which I saw there for the first time). Given the people involved, and the discussion up to that point, it is my understanding that Keith Bostic was the source of the modified license.

Eric responded to Florian's message:

> I have changed about 40% of the ncurses files to have the new copyright.

I hope you started from the cleaned-up version I made available.
Florian replied to Eric's mail:

> I hope you started from the cleaned-up version I made available.

I couldn't do that. I need to know who owned the original copyright, since
that person will also own the the new file, just with a different copyright
notice.
and

> Other than that, I have no pending issues.

I did not use that package, but a current snapshot of Thomas Dickey.
It does not make sense to use a really old ncurses-source like ncurses
1.9.9e. So we should agree on just using the development version.
Again, this was news to me. There was more. But first, RMS then sent mail to Florian, me and Zeyd (but not Juergen), outlining the process for the copyright assignments. I replied to RMS, noting that my agreement with my employer actually exempted me from that (though later RMS did not agree).

A week later (July 25), when RMS asked for updated status, it seemed to him that I was the only one to comment on the assignments. Zeyd in particular had not replied. Florian was able to contact Zeyd at this point.

August 1997
On August 24, RMS sent a draft of the copyright assignment, listing the four developers, the maintainer (Florian), and 14 minor contributors.

I noticed a typo, and in a followup reply to that thread, sent mail to RMS and Florian giving counts from my RCS logs, which could of course only identify contributors back to ncurses 1.9.9e. RMS asked for more information before 1.9.9e.

I commented that

The list of contributors at the bottom of README hasn't been updated
(except for Alexander's recent request) for some time - and Zeyd used
to have some additional names there, preceding the 1.8.5 release (which
I noticed recently while comparing versions).
RMS replied, requesting the additional names. I did more than that, giving line-counts for the ones that I could identify by comparing old releases of ncurses, as well as by studying Eric's patches. The final list of minor contributors includes the ones for whom I cited numbers. There were another 13 that we could have added to the list, but there were no numbers for those.

Zeyd did not reply to RMS's email; I provided RMS an alternate mailing address on August 27.

September 1997
Juergen and I discussed status in mid-September, and Juergen asked RMS what was going on. RMS replied on September 18 that he was waiting for Florian to okay the copyright assignment. Florian answered, saying that he agreed to it, had thought (since he was not an author) that it was not necessary.

With that done, RMS sent the final version of the copyright assignment to the five of us on September 19. It listed 23 minor contributors, though getting their assignments was not necessary at that point. There was a constraint on the agreement:

   This assignment is executed in multiple counterparts, each of which is
binding on the respective signer(s) even if other counterparts are delayed.
However, the Foundation will not begin distribution of the Program until it
has received counterparts signed by all of us.  If the Foundation does not
receive counterparts with signatures of all of us, within six months of
receiving the first counterpart, then this assignment is entirely void and
all rights revert to us.
Juergen reported on September 26 that he had snailed the signed document to RMS. I replied that I had mailed mine on Monday morning (September 22). RMS certainly had mine in hand by September 26, so all five had to be received by sometime in April 1998 for the agreement to be completed.

But we were not nearly done at that point. The following day, Eric replied to the thread discussing status:

Florian LaRoche.
> The current ncurses-snapshots seem to be quite stable, so we could
> make a new release soon.

There are at least two changes that need to be made in Dickey's snapshots
before a release; also, I want to add a new terminfo.master file.  Please
give me a chance to run an eyeball over a prerelease before you ship.
And let'd do it soon -- a release is long overdue and the Red Hat people
are begging for one.
I pointed out to Florian that there were problems with Eric's changes. Eric was not proposing to send patches against ncurses (which Florian considered suggesting), but to substitute the entire file. That would undo fixes that I had made. My reply to Florian pointed out an easily discussed specific issue as a start:

the terminfo stuff cannot be ifdef'd.  there is more than one problem
that I've corrected; the chief (noticeable) one is that it appears that
Eric at some point misunderstood the use of the setf/setb color controls
and modified all of the setaf/setab controls to be setf/setb.  So his
file is incompatible with SVr4 (colors are interchanged, e.g., red/blue).
Shortly after, I added that topic to my FAQ (Why are red/blue interchanged?).

On a related note, one of Eric's supporters sent a message to the mailing list on the next day, regarding ncurses versus Eric's copy of the terminfo database:

Any errors in the terminal database should be directed to the terminfo
maintainer (Eric S. Raymond), as the database is only included with
ncurses, not maintained by the ncurses folks.
However (see policy), I pointed out that Eric was free to use whatever changes he wanted from ncurses.

October 1997
RMS pointed out a missing step in my paperwork on October 2 (my existing agreement was not specific enough). That required another amendment to my employee agreement, which took until December 10 to resolve.

I followed up with a comment that the additional disclaimer for my employee agreement was being reviewed.

Shortly after that (October 6), Daniel Weaver started discussing tack, indicating that he would like to have it included with ncurses. We also discussed other changes, such as his improved descriptions for Wyse terminals.

November 1997
On November 4, RMS wrote to Juergen, cc'ing the six of us (counting Keith):

I received papers from you, from Tom Dickey, and from Zeyd.
I spoke with Eric a week ago and he said he would send them,
but I am not home so I do not know if they have arrived.

I have not heard from Florian at all.
There was no immediate followup to this. But initially unrelated, Daniel Weaver brought RMS into the discussion of tack. It turned out that some of Daniel's work had been incorporated into ncurses. That included part of the color computations, as well as about 900 lines of termcap definitions (anonymously via his work for Wyse). I commented that it sounded as if he should have been listed as a minor contributor, but RMS steered away from that, saying that Florian would fix the credits. (Changing the list of contributors would have required restarting the process to get the copyright assignments, so that would not have been a good thing).

RMS suggested to Daniel that he could either make tack a part of ncurses (which would use the same license), or distribute it with ncurses (which would allow using a different license). Daniel replied that he was willing to do either.

On November 20, RMS wrote that he had not heard from Florian for many weeks. Juergen provided a phone number, commenting that Florian and his wife were expecting a child.

RMS followed up on the 24th, having spoken with Florian. Florian had been too busy to read his email, but had agreed to send his assignment papers soon. (Florian was at that point also reconsidering whether he had enough time to act as the ncurses maintainer). RMS finished by saying that he had also spoken with Eric a few weeks before, and that Eric also had promised to send his papers.

RMS wrote to me the following day that he did not know who else might be suitable for the ncurses maintainer. I replied that there were few possibilities, but that it really should not take more than an hour per week.

December 1997
On December 7, RMS wrote to me, cc'ing Florian:

Eric sent papers, but unfortunately he used the wrong text for them.
So I asked him to try again.

Florian, have you sent your papers yet?
The others (Juergen, Zeyd, and people on the mailing list) were losing patience.

In a reply to RMS on December 18, Daniel indicated that he had just mailed his paperwork, and that he would like to use the same license as ncurses.

On the 19th, Zeyd proposed that we simply release it by Christmas. I pointed out that we could do this only with agreement from Eric. About an hour later, Eric replied to Zeyd, objecting to the proposal. Eric also stated that he had mailed his papers.

I asked RMS for clarification on that; RMS suggested that Eric may have been talking about the first time (with the wrong text). RMS also said that he had talked with Florian on the phone, and that Florian had sent in his papers.

Replying to RMS on the 20th, I suggested that (as a contingency) Daniel Weaver might be a suitable replacement for Florian, and to mention it to Florian as a possibility if he was unable to commit to the time. I discussed this with Daniel at the same time.

Florian wrote to RMS on December 22, cc'ing six of us (counting Alexander) that he had to resend his papers due to a problem with the address.

Daniel Weaver continued discussing licensing with RMS, and advising me of interesting developments. Part of this was Daniel's ongoing work to reuse some of the internal functions in the ncurses library in tack. On the 23rd, he reported that RMS had talked him into using GPL.

Discussing all of this (and the prospect of a release) with Florian on the 28th, I suggested tying off loose ends (such as tack and the OS/2 port), which would take it into January. For a release, I had to rebuild and test on each of the dozen or so platforms that I had access to.

January 1998
Discussing status with Florian on the 7th, Florian asked if Eric's papers had arrived. I pointed out that a few weeks before, RMS had been uncertain about that, suggesting that Eric had not resubmitted the paperwork. I cc'd RMS to get his advice.

RMS responded on the 9th, stating that he was away from email, but on return would phone Eric to remind him if the papers had not been mailed.

I replied, reporting that Florian had agreed to let me help him by writing scripts for updating the copyright notices. I completed those on January 17. One script removed the old notice, replacing it with a marker. The other script inserted the new marker. To avoid breakage, the scripts only modified files containing RCS keywords, hinting that they were not generated text.

RMS wrote on the 16th that he had received Florian's papers. He added that he had phoned Eric, finding that Eric had not mailed the papers yet, thinking there was no hurry. RMS urged him to mail the papers, saying that everyone else was waiting. I was unsurprised, but remarked in my reply that I thought we had only six more weeks (which was shorter than the actual time remaining).

On the 20th, I asked Florian if he had reviewed my scripts. I do not see a reply to that in my mail.

On January 22, RMS reported that Eric said he had mailed his papers.

Florian followed up on the next day, and we began discussing how to proceed (scripting, patches, prerelease).

On January 30, RMS again reported that he had received the wrong papers again from Eric, two days before. He still had not sent the papers when RMS called on the 30th (a Friday) to check on this.

February 1998
On Friday, February 6, RMS reported that Eric's wife said she mailed the envelope containing the papers on Tuesday (February 3). RMS expected to get the papers at his office on the following Tuesday or Wednesday.

On February 10, RMS wrote to me, Florian and Keith:

Today Eric's papers arrived, I checked them, and I signed them.
So the way is clear--please release as soon as you are ready!
I replied to RMS that I was doing test-builds, expecting to complete those in a few days. On the other hand, I had not gotten feedback from Florian regarding the scripts for updating the copyright notices. He replied without focussing on that, to discuss when and where to put a prerelease.

More than once, Florian had expressed an willingness to step aside once the release was done. I made no argument either way. But having Florian leave was not what RMS had in mind (the task would not be complete). Replying to Florian on February 11, RMS said:

    In short: You are the real maintainer of ncurses for me. But it is probably
    wise to neither list me as maintainer nor state my official disappearance.

Since the authors agreed based on the idea you would be the
maintainer, I think it is best to list you as the official maintainer,
and make that an honest statement by having you act as the "maintainer
in chief" in case there is a dispute among the major contributors.  In
the mean time, Thomas can do all the work and make all the decisions
when there is no dispute--which we hope will be all the time.

After some time (perhaps a year), if Eric remains uninvolved in
ncurses, it would be ok to change this and make Thomas the official
maintainer.  If he has been uninvolved for that long, he would have to
recognize that this is ok.
This was the basis for my resuming maintainership of ncurses a year and a half later:

Florian left,
RMS was unable to contact him, and
RMS found that there was no remaining obstacle.
RMS, when asked about the ".lsm" file, stated on February 13

We don't make entries in the "Linux system map" for GNU programs,
because GNU programs are not "part of Linux" or "for Linux".
They should run on Linux-based GNU systems, of course,
and the kernel is an important part of the system,
but we shouldn't treat it as if it were everything.
I removed it at that point.

At RMS's suggestion, we began moving the mailing list on February 16.

Florian reported on February 21 that Eric had sent mail, saying that Florian should not make a release without patches to the terminfo database. Florian asked Eric to send patches, but also told him that the current beta looked okay, and that he would like to make the release soon.

In reviewing Eric's first set of changes on the 28th, neither of us found those to be urgent. Florian noted of Eric's change to make the hashmap code "on" by default, that it had not been tested during the beta period. At that point, Eric had still promised patches for the terminfo.src file. Juergen agreed: make no major changes.

March 1998
However, Eric was allowed to make a last-minute change to the terminfo.src file, as seen in the ncurses 4.2 release summary. That changed about 400 lines of the file. Some parts were improvements; some were cosmetic (renaming entries or their descriptions). Some were neither. For instance, Eric replaced a year's notes from the change history (76 lines) with a cut-down version (29 lines) which was more than half describing the changes that Eric added in the other 350 lines of text. In doing that, it changed the attribution (noting that Daniel Weaver's name was removed).

I did some repairs in the following week's patch. Ultimately, I restored that section of the change history to provide before/after comparisons, in 2007-07-14.

ncurses 4.2 – March 2, 1998
The release announcement for ncurses 4.2 came 3 hours after the upload with Eric's changes.

License and Other Issues
Explaining the Delay
Going back to the timeline, one may ask what made Eric (the most self-proclaimed knowledgeable person about this process) take the longest to get a copyright assignment signed and mailed to RMS. Eric was (according to the comments in emails) also in fairly frequent phone contact with RMS.

Conversely, what prompted his completing the process? Eric was in no hurry when RMS talked with him on January 16. Even on January 22 he had not successfully completed the assignment.

That part is probably simpler to answer:

1998/01/22
the Beginning of Mozilla
1998/01/23
Netscape announces the release of the source code for Netscape Navigator 5.0
Browser War: A Concession And a Push (New York Times, January 23, 1998)
Netscape was making the source code available, but aimed at hobbyists.

Netscape started layoffs on this date (10% of 3000 employees according to an article in the San Francisco Gate).

This article notes that in the original announcement, modified versions of the source code were not allowed to be sold.

1998/01/30

"Open source" was not yet in Eric's vocabulary.

1998/02/10
change comment for CATB says
   Revision 1.31 February 10 1998 esr
   Added ``Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar!''
Bear in mind that few mainstream sources mentioned Eric's relationship to the Netscape announcement early. Recalling the newsgroup discussions, it seemed that came later (no earlier than the 27th).

Essentially, the delays were cut short, because Eric was unable to not complete the paperwork. Further delays would have interfered with his ability to exploit the Netscape announcement. Even had he chosen to walk away from it, there was a good potential for ncurses licensing being a liability.

Still, it was not obvious to Eric, since he waited until the day of his meeting to mail the form. Perhaps someone pointed it out to him.

Open Source Dispute
Along with revising CATB to hoist a new flag on it, Eric did the same in other parts of his web page. I noticed that he claimed to have been a principal developer of the "open source" ncurses. That failed scrutiny for several reasons:

the dictionary is clear on the meaning of "principal"; there is only one.
phrasing it as "one of the principal developers" sidesteps the issue. Eric was again explicitly claiming to be the maintainer.
the term "open source" did not exist at any point in time where Eric had any control over the development.
Eric did not ask for opinions from any of the authors or contributors to ncurses.
at that early stage, "open source" was a term used only by Eric (and his cronies), and predictably, took on a meaning based on their views. RMS had a different opinion of the term.
to remind the reader, it was the Free Software Foundation that held the copyright to ncurses at that point.
while Keith and others had no specific terminology for the nature of the ncurses license, RMS was clear starting in June 1997 that it would be "free software".
Having these issues in mind, I consulted with RMS (on February 13), who responded:

    btw, I'm not wholly clear on your position on "open source".

It means more or less the same thing as "free software", but I don't
think it is a good choice of terminology.  Please see
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-or-free.html
for my reasons.

In the GNU project, we will keep using the term "free software".
and further (on February 14):

    I think that some people are treating it as more than a synonym (or whatever),
    but trying to use it as a path to change how issues are interpreted.

I know, and I think that change is for the worse.  That is why
I urge people to keep using the term "Free Software".
Again, we had a policy. I summarized my position on the matter here, and, taking into account the behavior of both Eric and his cronies with respect to my work on ncurses over the following years, have not found a reason to amend it.

How is the License Improved?
While it is a clear improvement over the license that Eric and Zeyd used, the origin of the wording was unclear to me, as well as the reason for using a license which did not quite match others in use at that time. Reusing an existing license would for instance reduce arguments over interpretation.

Start by looking at the ncurses license, for example in ncurses.h:

 ****************************************************************************/
The ncurses license is said to be based on MIT-X11. When I read that, I have in mind the license used for X11 header files, which differ from ncurses. For example, here is the license from Xlib.h:

Copyright 1985, 1986, 1987, 1991, 1998  The Open Group

Except as contained in this notice, the name of The Open Group shall not be
used in advertising or otherwise to promote the sale, use or other dealings
in this Software without prior written authorization from The Open Group.
Only the first paragraph really differs. The last two differ in the way the copyright owner is mentioned, but that does not affect the meaning of the text.

Both forms of the license grant rights (that is how to interpret a license). Rights not granted are reserved.

After discarding the repetition regarding the copyright notice from the MIT-X11 license (compare with the second paragraph), there is not much left:

Permission to use, copy, modify, distribute, and sell this software and its documentation for any purpose is hereby granted without fee, provided that the above copyright notice appear in all copies and that both that copyright notice and this permission notice appear in supporting documentation.

That is, it lists anticipated uses ("use", "copy", "modify", "distribute", "sell") and combines that with "any purpose", and "without fee". Bear in mind that the MIT-X11 license is widely interpreted to grant the right to anyone to modify a program and distribute the modified program.

Trimming down the ncurses license for analysis is harder:

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, distribute with modifications, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

The ncurses license parallels some of MIT-X11:

"free of charge" corresponds to "without fee".

but ncurses differs:

ncurses mentions "any person", and "persons". What a "person" is can be subject to interpretation. MIT-X11 does not limit that, grants its permissions to whatever can use the rights.

ncurses lists uses which are not listed in MIT-X11, such as "merge", "publish", "distribute with modifications", "sublicense".

Considering the context in which the ncurses license was produced, the problem which it was intended to solve (by comparing the Eric+Zeyd license with MIT-X11) was the omission of "modify" from the list of uses. If an explicit "distribute with modifications" is legally necessary, then the MIT-X11 license, which lacks that explicit use, is defective. MIT-X11 has been in use for more than twenty years, so that argument seems implausible, due to extensive precedent.

Likewise, "merge" and "publish" are likely redundant (viz "modify" and "distribute").

In summary, the ncurses license appears to be a restating of the MIT-X11 license. But it is unclear if the changes were necessary.

But that MIT-X11 License...
I quoted the license from Xlib.h file. But some comments regarding MIT-X11 versus the ncurses license have gotten my attention. For instance in Debian #284340 MIT-X11 and the expat license differ only by the final clause dealing with advertising.

This anonymous discussion states that

the MIT license is the same as the ncurses license except for the “addition” of the advertising paragraph.

Expat uses the MIT license.

In other discussion, some arguments are made that the MIT license should be called the Expat license (apparently on the basis of distinguishing that from other MIT licenses.

That raises the issue: how are these licenses related?

To start, I noticed that the earliest date on the expat copyright is 1998. But I first saw the text for ncurses's license in July 1997.

If expat development had been well-known in 1997, then it would be possible for the ncurses license to be based on that in some way. Early expat development was discussed on the xml-dev mailing list.

Expat 1.0 was announced in August 1998, over a year later.

The announcement mentions earlier beta versions. The earliest of these appears to be in April 1998, not long after the ncurses 4.2 release. But in that message, James Clark stated that he was using the Mozilla Public License (none of the old versions of MPL bear any resemblance to MIT-X11); they are self-similar.

None of the messages through 1.0 mention licensing.

Subsequent messages mention dual-licensing (MPL and GPL), e.g., in the announcement of expat 1.1.

The MIT-style license used by expat was adopted in October 2000.

Noting this Licensing:MIT – FedoraProject page which quotes the same license as

Copyright (c) 1998, 1999, 2000 Thai Open Source Software Center Ltd

(the same author), it is possible that it was used by him in some other published work. Still, 1998 >1997.

Expat was not part of X11R6.
It was added to XFree86 on February 18, 2002 (according to XFree86 CVS).
In my 2006 snapshot, Expat comprises 15878 lines of the 3280100 total in XFree86.
That is about 0.5%, making it just a small part of the “extras” directory (602353 lines).

Incidentally, “contrib” and “extras” are not strictly considered part of XFree86. They were add-ons, for convenience.

Notwithstanding the copyright notice and mailing-list tidbits, I have have found no earlier sources than version 1.2 (all library files dated April 21, 2000 or later), with a separate copying.txt file (October 6, 2000).

Expat's author had no relationship with MIT (refer to his bio-page).
There are no pointers to an earlier instance of this license from MIT.
Lacking a better explanation, equate it with the CDK "BSD License".

To summarize,

the ncurses license is not based on the expat license in any way.

Expat's license is “MIT” because its author says so.

However, it is demonstrably not “MIT-X11”.

Continuing, the question is what MIT-X11 licenses are found (in X11 source code), and what is the closest match to the ncurses license.

A quick check of the X11R1 (September 1987) source code does not find “sublicense” used—except in a different way by two files. I happen to have a full XFree86 source tree.

There are 13144 files in the “xc” tree.

There are 6413 C-language files, totalling 3051851 lines.
Copyright and license notices appear in both C-language files as well as supporting build-scripts.

The word “sublicense” appears in 2968 files (compared with 6668 for “Permission” or 9400 for “Copyright”). Only about 500 of those files are older than November 2003. I see this text in the oldest of those 2968 files, xc/doc/specs/Xaw/Xtk.widg.front, dated April 1994:

.LP
Except as contained in this notice, the name of the X Consortium shall not be

The word “advertising” (from the last clause, which is the difference between MIT-X11 and expat) is used in 6506 files.

That is, after skipping the actual copyright notice, and changing “X Consortium” to “above copyright holders”, we have the ncurses license.

X11R6.3 was the current release at the time that the ncurses license text was first seen (July 1997):

6443 source files comprise the release

4689 have “Copyright”

4177 have “Permission”

2817 have “sublicense”

The oldest files with “sublicense” are copyright by Bitstream (May 11, 1991), and have a similar first paragraph.

The files starting with April 1994 with “sublicense” have the same license as the sample quoted above. In particular, this includes Xlib.h.

The remaining files are copyright by other organizations than X Consortium (such as fonts), or have no copyright keyword (such as generated documentation).

To summarize:

The license used by ncurses was the same as that used in X11R6.3.

The text of the license is at least 3 years older (April 1994) than X11R6.3's release.

The “sublicense” wording was dropped later by The Open Group, apparently in 1998.

That would make the license now used in X11 header files no longer MIT-X11.

The advertising paragraph was not added for ncurses.

Comments that FSF added this are likely based on confusion regarding the license changes made by The Open Group (which took over the sources following the demise of X Consortium at the end of 1996).

For comparison, one can readily find evidence that the anonymous not-a-lawyer topic promoting Expat as the MIT license on the Linux Information Project has been used as the basis for more official-sounding pages “MIT License”:

OSI

Fedora

SPDX

These all are lacking in useful information, e.g., dates and authors which would help show how the information evolved (or simply migrated). I noticed the OSI page, of course in the first draft of this page. In later investigation (2014), I noticed the Fedora and SPDX pages, noting that the latter generally copies from the others after some discussion, e.g.,

Legal Team – minutes – 2013-04-16
This proposed making templates to match subsets of the MIT licenses.
For instance, this page claims that these templates exist. Searching for templates on this site found only deleted pages, no content.
Likewise, the attachments for a relevant page do not exist.

Legal Team – minutes – 2013-06-06
The comment that “old” MIT - never considered (? may have fell through the cracks)” seemed interesting, until reading other pages it was clear that this referred to an earlier timeframe than X development.

A 2012 paper by Trevor Maryka presents some numbers illustrating an investigation into the features of different versions of the MIT and MIT-X11 licenses. The numbers presented are for Debian 6.

Here are their main pages, for future consideration:

Fedora

SPDX

Occasionally someone else becomes interested in the topic. In The mysterious history of the MIT License, Gordon Haff stated that “The "modern" MIT License is the same as the license used for the Expat XML parser library beginning in about 1998. The MIT License using this text was part of the first group of licenses approved by the OSI in 1999” and points to the Wayback machine crawl of opensource.org for August 15, 2000 (no earlier data is available).

Incidentally, some readers are confused by the “All Rights Reserved” found in many files of the X releases (4490 occurrences in my XFree86 snapshot for instance), supposing it to be part of the license. Instead, it is part of the copyright notice, and was required (until a debatable date, depending upon the source used) due to the United States' participation in the Buenos Aires Convention of 1910. Its absence from ncurses is likely due to Stallman's preference for the form of the copyright notice versus the GPL.

History and License
History of the software
Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl/) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC. Guido remains Python’s principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us/) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team. In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope Corporation; see https://www.zope.org/). In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property. Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org/ for the Open Source Definition). Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.

Note GPL-compatible doesn’t mean that we’re distributing Python under the GPL. All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a modified version without making your changes open source. The GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL; the others don’t.
Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido’s direction to make these releases possible.
